        <h1 class="center yellow_bt_brdr">What is Angular?</h1>
        <h5 class="center">Angular is a web framework developed and maintained by Google that was released under the name of AngularJS back in 2010. At the time, it became one of the most popular web frameworks. 
            This was mainly due to its features like two-way data binding and dependency injection, 
            and of course by being backed by a tech giant.</h5>

                    <h2>Cons of Angular Development</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Due to a layered architecture angular can end up being a slightly difficult framework to debug sometimes and people who are not used to n-tier architectures can find some of the concepts as abstruse.</li>
                        <li>Especially debugging the scopes in a large angular application can be a pain point at times.</li>
                        <li>All the injectors into angular are also hierarchical in nature and cause angular to have deep nesting sometimes.</li>
                        <li>A problem called injector bubbling shows one of the problems with nested scopes.</li>
                        <li>Due to two-way data binding especially on old devices, angular dom-manipulation can also lead to a performance tradeoff since the browser will be super busy manipulating the dom elements and will take a lot of the compute resources.</li>

						<h2>Same info about Flask and back-end part</h2>
						<p>We have used Flask as our backend framework which is great for Python. There are so many popular websites such as Pintrest and Linkedin which are using this framework in their web applications. Some of the strengths of this framework are, there are so many easy feaurues available in this firemark that can help to create some web applications in python in comparison of the other frameworks. New developers can make the web applications more flexible, quicker, and in a single python file. There is a toolkit available for users in this firemark which makes your web application proper in the mobile browsers without any use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that is called Bootstrap toolkit. Besides, there are some weakness always available in everything as this framework has some as well. This frame work is not very suitable for the huge applications. Also, flask has a small community in compare of other other frameworks. In addition, as Allwin Raju, a Python developer said, “Flask does not provide authentication. There is no login functionality.”</p>
